# Charges and Conductors
## Charges
- There are two types of charges
  - $+V_e$, $-V_e$
- Opposte charges attract, like charges repel
- Indicated with $Q$
- Measured in Coulomb ($C$) (don't add an 's)
- Intrensic property of electrons and protons

## Atoms
- Electron shells are a thingâ„¢
- Atoms want stability (8s are stable)
- Basically just remember AP chem tbh

## Materials
- Everything can be categorized in one of three ways
  1. Conductors
  2. Insulators
  3. Semiconductors
- Conductors **do** allow energy to move between valency and conduction bands (**no** energy gap)
- Insulators don't allow energy to move between valency and conduction bands (**large** energy gap)
- Semiconductors **sometimes** allow energy to move between valency and conduction bands (**small** energy gap)
  - IE: Silicon/Germanium have 4 electrons in the valence orbit, making them good semiconductors
  - Usually varies in conductance based on energy level/heat
