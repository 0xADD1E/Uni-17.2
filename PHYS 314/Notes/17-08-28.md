## Charge Polarization
- Applying charged particles to an uncharged conductor, oppsite charged particles trend towards the charged particle

## Electoscopes
- Allows to detect if a body is charged or not
- Uncharged conductor metals with movable leafs allow to detect if a body is charged or not
- Giving the electrosope a charge allows you to detect which charge a body has

## Coulomb's Law

Newtons law of gravity stuffs: $F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$
- m = mass of body
- r = distance
- G = gravitational constant ($6.674E-11 nm^2/kg^2$)

Coulomb's law: $F=\frac{KQ_1Q_2}{r^2}$
- Q = charges
- r = distance
- K = proportionality constant ($8.99E9 nm^2/c^2$)

Only useful for point charges, at rest

### Example:
Two charges (one positive $1\mu c$, one negitive $1.5\mu c$) are placed 2cm apart. What is the force between them?


$$Q1 = 1E-6 c$$
$$Q2 = 1.5E-6 c$$
$$R = 0.02m$$
$$F_{12} = 33.75N \rightarrow$$
$$F_{21} = 33.75N \leftarrow$$
