The murder was committed by the maid only if she believed her life was in danger. Had the butler done it, it would have been done silently and the body would not have been mutilated. As a matter of fact it was done silently; however, the maid’s life was not in danger. The butler did it if and only if the maid failed to do it. Hence the maid did it.
